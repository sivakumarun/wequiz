BROWSER CACHE FIX - STEP BY STEP
====================================

Your code is updated correctly, but your browser is caching the old JavaScript.

SOLUTION - Do ALL of these steps:

1. Close ALL browser tabs/windows showing localhost:3000

2. Open a NEW INCOGNITO/PRIVATE window:
   - Chrome: Ctrl + Shift + N
   - Edge: Ctrl + Shift + P
   - Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + P

3. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

4. You should now see:
   ✓ Leaderboard: "⚠️ Clear All Leaderboard" button
   ✓ Leaderboard: Trophy emoji, medals, tiebreaker banner
   ✓ Question Management: Checkboxes and bulk delete buttons

IF STILL NOT WORKING:
- In the incognito window, press F12 (open DevTools)
- Go to "Network" tab
- Check "Disable cache" checkbox
- Refresh the page (F5)

The code IS correct. This is 100% a browser caching issue.
